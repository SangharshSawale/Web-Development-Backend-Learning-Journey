# 🚀 Backend Learning – MongoDB with mongosh (Command Prompt)

Hi, I’m **Sangharsh** 👋  
Today I learned and practiced how to work with MongoDB using the **mongosh shell** and execute database commands directly from the **Windows Command Prompt**.

This folder contains my practical work for **MongoDB using mongosh**.

## 🧠 What I learned and practiced today

### 1️⃣ Connecting to MongoDB using mongosh

- I learned how to start the MongoDB shell using the `mongosh` command.

- insert a single document using `insertOne()`
- insert multiple documents using `insertMany()`

---

### 4️⃣ Reading documents (find operations)

I learned how to:

- filter records using conditions

---

### 5️⃣ Using query operators

I learned how to use MongoDB operators such as:

- `$gt`

- query nested fields using dot notation  
  (example: `performance.marks`)

---

### 9️⃣ Deleting documents

I learned how to:

- delete a single document using `deleteOne()`

---

### 🔟 Executing commands from a file

I learned how to:

- write mongosh commands in a `.js` file
- start mongosh from Command Prompt
- execute all commands using:

---

## 📂 Files in this folder

- `college-shell.js`  
Contains all my MongoDB practice commands executed using mongosh.

- `README.md`  
Learning notes and explanation for this practice.

---

## 🛠️ Tools used

- MongoDB
- mongosh
- Windows Command Prompt

---

## 🎯 Summary

Today I learned and practiced how to work with MongoDB directly using the mongosh shell.

I performed complete CRUD operations and also learned how to execute all mongosh commands from a script file using the terminal.

This helped me clearly understand how MongoDB is used at the database level without using any backend framework.

---

## 🌱 Learning note

All the commands in `college-shell.js` were executed and tested directly in **Windows Command Prompt** using mongosh.

VS Code was used only to write and save the file, not to run the commands.
