# 🗄️ DBMS Revision & Deep Practice – SQL (Backend Learning)

Hi, I’m **Sangharsh** 👋

In my DBMS subject I already learned these SQL topics before.
Today, I revised and practiced them again deeply for my backend learning
and better understanding of database concepts.

This folder contains one complete SQL practice file which covers
almost all important SQL queries.

  → Single SQL file covering all database and table related queries.

## 🎯 Purpose

Even though I already learned these topics in my DBMS subject,
I revised and practiced them again deeply to:

- strengthen my SQL fundamentals
- prepare for backend development
- understand how databases work with backend servers

This practice will help me later while working with
Express.js, APIs and real database connections.
